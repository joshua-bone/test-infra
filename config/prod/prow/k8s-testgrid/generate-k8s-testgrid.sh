# Docker's -i/--interactive allows you to send commands to the container via standard input ("STDIN"), which means you can "interactively" type commands to the pseudo-tty/terminal created by the -t switch.
# if youâ€™d like Docker to automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits, you can add the --rm flag
